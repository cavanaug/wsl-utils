# Windows Integration Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Safe Windows Command Execution
Scripts SHALL execute Windows commands using safe parameter passing methods that prevent injection attacks.

#### Scenario: Command execution with arguments
- **GIVEN** a Windows command needs to be executed with user-provided arguments
- **WHEN** the command is invoked via PowerShell
- **THEN** arguments SHALL be passed as separate parameters or properly escaped
- **AND** special characters in arguments SHALL NOT be interpreted as PowerShell syntax

#### Scenario: Path conversion for Windows commands
- **GIVEN** a Windows command receives WSL paths as arguments
- **WHEN** the paths are converted using wslpath
- **THEN** the converted paths SHALL be properly quoted
- **AND** spaces and special characters in paths SHALL be preserved

### Requirement: Centralized PowerShell Configuration
Scripts SHALL use centralized configuration for PowerShell executable paths to ensure consistency.

#### Scenario: PowerShell path definition
- **GIVEN** multiple scripts need to invoke PowerShell
- **WHEN** PowerShell executable path is needed
- **THEN** the path SHALL be obtained from a central configuration
- **AND** all scripts SHALL use the same path resolution method

#### Scenario: PowerShell path override
- **GIVEN** a user needs to specify a custom PowerShell location
- **WHEN** the configuration is loaded
- **THEN** environment variable overrides SHALL be respected
- **AND** the override SHALL be used consistently across all scripts

### Requirement: UTF-8 Encoding Standardization
Scripts SHALL use a centralized library for UTF-8 encoding conversion to eliminate code duplication.

#### Scenario: UTF-16LE to UTF-8 conversion
- **GIVEN** a Windows command outputs UTF-16LE encoded text
- **WHEN** the output needs to be processed in WSL
- **THEN** a shared UTF-8 conversion function SHALL be used
- **AND** the conversion SHALL handle BOM markers correctly

#### Scenario: Consistent encoding across tools
- **GIVEN** multiple scripts need UTF-8 encoding functionality
- **WHEN** encoding conversion is required
- **THEN** all scripts SHALL use the same shared library function
- **AND** encoding behavior SHALL be consistent

### Requirement: Windows Environment Variable Access
Scripts SHALL safely access and cache Windows environment variables with proper validation.

#### Scenario: Environment variable caching
- **GIVEN** Windows environment variables are needed
- **WHEN** the cache is built
- **THEN** variables SHALL be retrieved once and cached
- **AND** the cache SHALL be validated before use

#### Scenario: WIN_* variable exposure
- **GIVEN** WSL scripts need access to Windows paths
- **WHEN** environment is initialized
- **THEN** key Windows variables SHALL be exposed with WIN_ prefix
- **AND** variables SHALL be converted to WSL path format where appropriate

### Requirement: Windows Executable Resolution
Scripts SHALL efficiently resolve Windows executable paths using caching and fallback mechanisms.

#### Scenario: Cached executable lookup
- **GIVEN** a Windows executable needs to be located
- **WHEN** the executable path is requested
- **THEN** the cache SHALL be checked first
- **AND** PowerShell Get-Command SHALL be used only if not in cache

#### Scenario: Executable not found handling
- **GIVEN** a requested Windows executable does not exist
- **WHEN** resolution is attempted
- **THEN** a clear error message SHALL inform the user
- **AND** suggestions for similar executables MAY be provided

### Requirement: Timeout Protection for Windows Commands
Scripts SHALL implement timeouts for Windows command execution to prevent indefinite blocking.

#### Scenario: Command with timeout
- **GIVEN** a Windows command might hang or take excessive time
- **WHEN** the command is executed
- **THEN** a timeout SHALL be enforced (default 30 seconds)
- **AND** the command SHALL be terminated if timeout is exceeded

#### Scenario: Configurable timeout
- **GIVEN** different commands have different time requirements
- **WHEN** timeout is configured
- **THEN** the timeout value SHALL be configurable per command or globally
- **AND** reasonable defaults SHALL be provided
