# Performance Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Parallel Windows Executable Cache Building
The Windows executable cache building process SHALL use parallelization to reduce build time.

#### Scenario: Parallel directory scanning
- **GIVEN** the Windows PATH contains multiple directories
- **WHEN** the executable cache is built
- **THEN** directories SHALL be scanned in parallel
- **AND** a throttle limit SHALL prevent excessive resource usage

#### Scenario: Performance improvement measurement
- **GIVEN** parallel cache building is implemented
- **WHEN** performance is measured against sequential implementation
- **THEN** build time SHALL be reduced by at least 50%
- **AND** the cached results SHALL be identical to sequential approach

#### Scenario: Concurrent cache building safety
- **GIVEN** multiple processes attempt to build cache simultaneously
- **WHEN** parallel operations are performed
- **THEN** no race conditions SHALL occur
- **AND** file locks SHALL prevent concurrent modifications

### Requirement: Efficient Pipeline Processing
Scripts SHALL optimize text processing pipelines to minimize subprocess creation and improve performance.

#### Scenario: Single-tool text processing
- **GIVEN** multiple grep and sed operations are needed
- **WHEN** the operations can be combined into awk
- **THEN** a single awk command SHALL be used
- **AND** the number of subprocesses SHALL be minimized

#### Scenario: Pipeline benchmark verification
- **GIVEN** an optimized pipeline replaces multiple pipes
- **WHEN** execution time is measured
- **THEN** the optimized version SHALL execute faster
- **AND** CPU usage SHALL be reduced

### Requirement: Cache Invalidation Strategy
Cached data SHALL have appropriate invalidation strategies to balance freshness and performance.

#### Scenario: Cache age checking
- **GIVEN** a cache file exists
- **WHEN** the cache is accessed
- **THEN** the cache age SHALL be checked
- **AND** the cache SHALL be regenerated if older than threshold (e.g., 24 hours)

#### Scenario: Force cache rebuild
- **GIVEN** a user needs to force cache regeneration
- **WHEN** a rebuild flag is provided
- **THEN** the cache SHALL be rebuilt regardless of age
- **AND** the new cache SHALL be immediately available

### Requirement: Minimized Subprocess Creation
Scripts SHALL minimize unnecessary subprocess creation through efficient use of bash built-ins.

#### Scenario: Built-in string manipulation
- **GIVEN** string manipulation is needed
- **WHEN** both built-in and external tools are available
- **THEN** bash built-ins SHALL be preferred over external commands
- **AND** subprocesses SHALL only be created when necessary

#### Scenario: Unnecessary subshell elimination
- **GIVEN** a subshell is used for operations that don't require isolation
- **WHEN** the code is refactored
- **THEN** the subshell SHALL be eliminated
- **AND** functionality SHALL remain equivalent
