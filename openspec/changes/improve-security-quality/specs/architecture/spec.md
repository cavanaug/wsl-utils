# Architecture Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Centralized Configuration Management
The project SHALL provide a centralized configuration library that all scripts source for consistent settings.

#### Scenario: Configuration library loading
- **GIVEN** a script needs configuration values
- **WHEN** the script initializes
- **THEN** it SHALL source lib/wslutil-common.sh
- **AND** all WIN_* environment variables SHALL be available

#### Scenario: Configuration value defaults
- **GIVEN** the configuration library is loaded
- **WHEN** environment variables are not already set
- **THEN** sensible defaults SHALL be provided
- **AND** defaults SHALL use standard WSL path conventions

#### Scenario: Configuration override
- **GIVEN** a user sets environment variables before running scripts
- **WHEN** the configuration library is loaded
- **THEN** user-provided values SHALL take precedence over defaults
- **AND** the override mechanism SHALL be documented

### Requirement: Centralized Logging Framework
The project SHALL provide a centralized logging library for consistent log formatting and management.

#### Scenario: Logging function usage
- **GIVEN** a script needs to log information
- **WHEN** the logging function is called
- **THEN** it SHALL format the log entry with timestamp
- **AND** it SHALL write to the appropriate log file with proper permissions

#### Scenario: Debug logging control
- **GIVEN** the WSLUTIL_DEBUG environment variable is set
- **WHEN** logging functions are called
- **THEN** log entries SHALL be written to log files
- **AND** when WSLUTIL_DEBUG is unset, detailed logging SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: Log rotation consideration
- **GIVEN** log files grow over time
- **WHEN** log files exceed a size threshold
- **THEN** log rotation strategy SHALL be documented
- **AND** old logs MAY be automatically archived or removed

### Requirement: Security Validation Library
The project SHALL provide a security validation library with reusable functions for common security checks.

#### Scenario: Path validation function
- **GIVEN** a script receives user-provided paths
- **WHEN** the path validation function is called
- **THEN** it SHALL check if the path is within allowed boundaries
- **AND** it SHALL return success or failure with clear error message

#### Scenario: Input sanitization function
- **GIVEN** user input needs to be logged or displayed
- **WHEN** the sanitization function is called
- **THEN** it SHALL remove or escape dangerous characters
- **AND** it SHALL prevent injection attacks

#### Scenario: Command injection prevention helper
- **GIVEN** a script needs to construct PowerShell commands safely
- **WHEN** the safe command construction helper is used
- **THEN** it SHALL properly escape all user input
- **AND** it SHALL prevent command injection

### Requirement: Shared UTF-8 Encoding Library
The project SHALL provide a shared library for UTF-8 encoding operations to eliminate code duplication.

#### Scenario: UTF-8 conversion function
- **GIVEN** a script needs to convert Windows output to UTF-8
- **WHEN** the shared conversion function is called
- **THEN** it SHALL handle UTF-16LE input correctly
- **AND** it SHALL output valid UTF-8

#### Scenario: Streaming UTF-8 conversion
- **GIVEN** large amounts of Windows output need conversion
- **WHEN** the streaming conversion function is used
- **THEN** it SHALL process data in chunks efficiently
- **AND** it SHALL not load entire output into memory

### Requirement: Comprehensive Test Coverage
The project SHALL maintain test suites covering critical functionality including security, error handling, and integration.

#### Scenario: Security test suite
- **GIVEN** security-critical functions exist in the codebase
- **WHEN** the security test suite is executed
- **THEN** it SHALL test for command injection prevention
- **AND** it SHALL test for path traversal prevention
- **AND** it SHALL verify secure file permissions

#### Scenario: Error handling test suite
- **GIVEN** scripts handle various error conditions
- **WHEN** the error handling test suite is executed
- **THEN** it SHALL test missing executable scenarios
- **AND** it SHALL test invalid argument scenarios
- **AND** it SHALL verify proper error messages and exit codes

#### Scenario: Integration test suite
- **GIVEN** scripts integrate with Windows commands
- **WHEN** the integration test suite is executed
- **THEN** it SHALL test actual Windows command execution
- **AND** it SHALL test path conversion end-to-end
- **AND** it SHALL verify clipboard and browser operations

#### Scenario: Test coverage measurement
- **GIVEN** all test suites are implemented
- **WHEN** code coverage is measured
- **THEN** critical security paths SHALL have >90% coverage
- **AND** overall code coverage SHALL be >80%

### Requirement: Modular Script Architecture
Scripts SHALL be organized into focused, reusable modules with clear separation of concerns.

#### Scenario: Library organization
- **GIVEN** common functionality is needed across multiple scripts
- **WHEN** the functionality is implemented
- **THEN** it SHALL be placed in a shared library under lib/
- **AND** the library SHALL have a single, well-defined purpose

#### Scenario: Script sourcing pattern
- **GIVEN** a script needs to use shared library functions
- **WHEN** the script is executed
- **THEN** it SHALL source required libraries at initialization
- **AND** it SHALL check for library availability before use

#### Scenario: Dependency documentation
- **GIVEN** libraries depend on each other
- **WHEN** dependencies are established
- **THEN** they SHALL be clearly documented in comments
- **AND** circular dependencies SHALL be avoided
